# Madness, Desolation And Darkness
_Source: The Book of Desolation (2024)_

Hive Secundus, the Secundan Abyss and the wasteland that surrounds them are especially deadly environments, even by the bleak standards of Necromunda. Explorers wishing to cross to the fallen hive and delve into the Underhells themselves must contend with the ever-present storm that hangs over the exclusion zone, and the
perpetual gloom of the Abyss and Underhells itself. Of equal danger is the lack of resources, gangs scrabbling for what weapons and wargear they can get hold of as they get further and further from civilisation. Finally, there is the unsettling psychic presence of the Broodmind as it projects its will from the depths of the destroyed city, inspiring fear and Macness in all who feel its touch.

The following rules apply to all games played during the Underhelis Campaign, depending on which campaign phase is active (see page 67).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Underhells Campaign is divided into a number of campaign cycles, broken up by two cycles of downtime after each time the explorers move on to a new region. The exact number of campaign cycles is dependent on how long it takes the gangs to explore each region, but will typically run for at least seven to nine cycles. For most groups each cycle is a week, as this is usually how often gaming groups or groups of friends get together to play, however, if players prefer then a cycle can represent a longer or shorter period of real time. The first step in setting up the campaign is for the Arbitrator to determine the start date and the end date. They then share this information with the players.
