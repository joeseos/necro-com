# Madness, Desolation And Darkness
_Source: The Book of Desolation (2024)_

Hive Secundus, the Secundan Abyss and the wasteland that surrounds them are especially deadly environments, even by the bleak standards of Necromunda. Explorers wishing to cross to the fallen hive and delve into the Underhells themselves must contend with the ever-present storm that hangs over the exclusion zone, and the
perpetual gloom of the Abyss and Underhells itself. Of equal danger is the lack of resources, gangs scrabbling for what weapons and wargear they can get hold of as they get further and further from civilisation. Finally, there is the unsettling psychic presence of the Broodmind as it projects its will from the depths of the destroyed city, inspiring fear and Macness in all who feel its touch.

The following rules apply to all games played during the Underhelis Campaign, depending on which campaign phase is active (see page 67). 

Madness[​](#madness "Direct link to Madness")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Ghost Of The Dead[​](#ghost-of-the-dead "Direct link to Ghost of the Dead")

*   Archeo-hunter affiliated fighters who fail to rally after gaining the Broken condition must pass a Willpower check or gain the Insane condition.
*   Malstrain affiliated fighters apply a -1 modifier to all Nerve tests.

### Echoes In The Abyss[​](#echoes-in-the-abyss "Direct link to Echoes in the Abyss")

*   Archeo-hunter affiliated fighters who fail to rally after gaining the Broken condition gain the Insane condition.
*   Malstrain affiliated fighters are unaffected.

### Shadow Of The Broodmind[​](#shadow-of-the-broodminf "Direct link to Shadow Of The Broodmind")

*   Archeo-hunter affiliated fighters who would gain the Broken condition gain the Insane condition instead.
*   Malstrain affiliated fighters apply a +1 modifier to all Nerve tests.

:::info A Special Kind Of Madness

In the Underhelis Campaign, fighters who become subject to the Insane condition act a little differently. On a result of 3-4 on the Insanity table, where the opposing player would normally control the fighter, the fighter instead counts as a Malstrain fighter and follows the activation guidelines as detailed in Roaming Horrors as follows. Malstrain fighters have a Nature of Cautious if armed with a Special or Heavy Weapon and Aggressive otherwise.
