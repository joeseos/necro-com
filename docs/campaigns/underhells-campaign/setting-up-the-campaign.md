# Setting Up The Campaign
_Source: The Book of Desolation (2024)_

Setting up an Underhells Campaign is a task that falls to the Arbitrator. To set up the campaign, the Arbitrator must make sure that all the players have founded their gang. This is best done in a single evening or session where everyone playing in the campaign meets and goes through all the steps of setting up the campaign together and generally gets excited about the fun ahead.

Set Start And End Dates[​](#set-start-and-end-dates "Direct link to Set Start And End Dates")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Underhells Campaign is divided into a number of campaign cycles, broken up by two cycles of downtime after each time the explorers move on to a new region. The exact number of campaign cycles is dependent on how long it takes the gangs to explore each region, but will typically run for at least seven to nine cycles. For most groups each cycle is a week, as this is usually how often gaming groups or groups of friends get together to play, however, if players prefer then a cycle can represent a longer or shorter period of real time. The first step in setting up the campaign is for the Arbitrator to determine the start date and the end date. They then share this information with the players. 

Gang Composition[​](#gang-composition "Direct link to Gang Composition")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When founding a gang for an Underhells Campaign, follow the rules presented in the _Necromunda Core Rulebook_:

*   Gangs have 1,000 credits available for their initial gang.
*   Depending on their Allegiance, gangs will either add a Ferryman team or have additional credits to spend on Crew, vehicles or fighters that come by default with Wargear that grants the Mounted condition (such as the Ash Waste Nomads Wy’tari Stormcaller), or on Wargear that grants the Mounted condition (see page 65).

Choosing Sides[​](#choosing-sides "Direct link to Choosing Sides")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When founding a gang in the Underhells Campaign, each player must decide if they are either working under the sway of the Malstrain Patriarch or raiding the ruins of Hive Secundus in search of archeotech. Each comes with its own benefits as detailed below.

Benefits Of The Archeo-Hunters [​](#benefits-of-the-archeo-hunters "Direct link to Benefits Of The Archeo-Hunters")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is impossible for a gang to cross the Dust Wall without employing a Ferryman team to guide them. The following rules apply to all Archeo-hunter Allegiance Gangs: 

*   Archeo-hunter Allegiance gangs gain a Ferryman team for the duration of the Incursion and Delving phases (sce page 104-106).
*   This Allegiance changes how the gang is affected by the Madness and Desolation rules (see page 71).

Benefits Of The Malstrain [​](#benefits-of-the-malstrain "Direct link to Benefits Of The Malstrain")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maistrain Allegiance gangs have eked out an existence within the Dust Wall and have repurposed much of the machinery left from the fall of Hive Secundus into transports for themselves. The following rules apply to ait Maistrain Allegiance gangs: 

*   Malstrain Allegiance gangs gain an additional 400 credits when being founded - this can only be spent on Crew, vehicles or fighters that come by defautt with Wargear that grants the Mounted condition (such as the Ash Waste Nomads Wy tari Stormcalier), or on Wargear that grants the Mounted condition. Any unspent credits from this allowance are lost after the gang és founded (note that credits may be spent from the gang's initial 1,000 credits on vehicles and Wargear that grants the Mounted condition as well). 
*   At the start of each battle, before the first roll for Priority, Malstrain Allegiance gangs may apply either a +1 or -1 modifier to all rolls to generate Roaming Horrors for the duration of the battle.
*   This Allegiance changes how the gang Is affected by the Madness and Desolation rules (see page 71). 

:::info Balancing The Malstrain And Archeo-Hunters 

The Underhetils Campaign has been designed to work with any mix of Matstrain and Archeo-hunter gangs: it is also'just as possible to find the agents of the Malstrain fighting amongst themselves to increase their personal power 3s it is for the teams of Archeo-hunters to squabble over the sécrets they uncover, However, as a guideline, an Underhells Campaign should inctude at least one gang aligned with the Archeo-hunters. Other alternatives include all gangs but one being aligned with the Archeo-hunters - representing a lone gang trying to wrest the riches of Secundus- from the Underhells.

Determine Territories[​](#determine-territories "Direct link to Determine Territories")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the start of each campaign cycle, each gang discards all Territories they control (unless stated otherwise) and randomly determines the next Territory they move to by rolling on the relevant table as follows (multiple gangs may have the same Territory and a gang may randomly generate the same Territory as they just discarded).

Issuing And Accepting Challenges[​](#issuing-and-accepting-challenges "Direct link to Issuing And Accepting Challenges")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During an Underhells Campaign, battles are fought on a challenge basis: 

*   During each cycle, each player may issue one challenge to another gang: 
    *   In the first campaign cycle, challenges are made in a random order. 
    *   In later cycles, they are made in ascending order of Gang Rating, starting with the gang with the lowest Gang Rating. If two gangs have the same Gang Rating, the winner of a roll-off makes their challenge first. 
*   If one of a gang's fighters has been Captured by another gang, that gang may issue a challenge to the captors to play the Defend the Camp scenario (see page 86). 
*   When a gang is challenged, they may accept or decline. if the challenge is accepted, a battle is fought. If the challenge is declined, the gang that issued the challenge gains 2 Exploration points. 
*   If a gang receives two or more challenges within a single campaign cycle, they may decline the second and any subsequent challenges without the opposing fang gaining Exploration points. 
*   If a player has played all outstanding battles (including their issued challenge and any challenges accepted) and there is still time left in the campaign cycle, they may issue another challenge. 

### Scenario Selection Table[​](#scenario-selection-table "Direct link to Scenario Selection Table")

When a challenge is issued, roll 2D6 on the table that follows for the current phase to determine which scenario is used. If the scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, the player that issued the shallenge is the attacker.
