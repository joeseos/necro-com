# Using The Campaign
_Source: The Book of Desolation (2024)_

The Underhells Campaign is a complete narrative campaign that can be used alongside the _Necromunda Core Rulebook_. Unlike other Necromunda campaigns, it follows a group of daring explorers delving into the ancient ruins of Secundus in search of fabled archeotech. Each player takes on the role of a gang crossing the cursed wastes around the fallen hive and then descending into its ruined depths. Along the way they must fight the minions of the Matstrain Patriarch, and hopefully escape with their lives! 

The Arbitrator[​](#the-arbitrator "Direct link to The Arbitrator")
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Underhells Campaign requires one of the players to take on the role of an Arbitrator. It is the Arbitrator's job to keep track of victories, offer guidance for the players and control any random events or elements, In the Underhells Campaign the Arbitrator's responsibilities include:

*   Organising the players and helping them to create their gangs.
*   Keeping track of the players’ progress through the exclusion zone around Secundus and keeping them informed as to the progression of the campaign. 
*   Deciding when each phase of the campaign begins and ends, as well as when the overall campaign begins and ends.

The Gangs[​](#the-gangs "Direct link to The Gangs")
---------------------------------------------------

There are two opposing forces in an Underhells Campaign: the archeotech hunters who have crossed the Dust Wall seeking the lost riches of Hive Secundus, and the corrupted followers of the Malstrain Patriarch who Oppose their progress every step of the way. While the campaign works well with Secundan incursion gangs facing off against Malstrain Corrupted gangs, the Arbitrator can allow any gang to delve into the ruins, most factions on Necromunda having ample the reasons to send their fighters into the exclusion zone. 

Race To Secundus [​](#controlling-territories "Direct link to Controlling Territories")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike other campalgns that focus on gangs fighting over part of he underhive or a region of the ash wastes, the Underhells Campaign represents rivals fighting their way across the exclusion zone and into the Secundan Abyss and the Underhells beyond. Along the way they must face each other, the foul denizens that lurk beyond the Dust Wall, and atternpt to recover as much valuable archeotech as possible. 

Territories And Phases [​](#controlling-territories "Direct link to Territories And Phases")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To represent the long and arduous journey across hundreds of kilometres of hostile wasteland, the Underhells Campaign is divided into three phases (the Incursion Phase, Delving Phase and Survival Phase), separated by two Downtime phases (see page 69) where gangs may rest, recover and re-equip their fighters. In these three phases gangs will each hold a single Territory each campaign cycle, representing their camp along the way. At the end of the cycle, after the benefits of the Territory have been gathered, they will move on to a new camp and generate a new random Territory[generate a new random Territory](/docs/campaigns/underhells-campaign/territories). 

Territories are also keyed to different phases (e., regions) and so depending on the phase different Territories will be available for the gangs to make camp in.

Pre- And Post-Battle Sequence[​](#pre--and-post-battle-sequence "Direct link to Pre- And Post-Battle Sequence")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Underhells Campaign uses all of the standard rules for the pre- and post-battle sequences presented in the _Necromunda Core Rulebook_ including the gaining and spending of XP with the following exceptions:  

*   No Territory is nominated as the Stake for battles.
*   The Assign/Reassign Te rritory step of the post-battle sequence Is skipped.  
*   Captives may not be sold to the Guilders.
*   The Visit the Trading Post sub-step of the Update roster step of the post-battle sequence is affected by the [Desolation](/docs/campaigns/underhells-campaign/madness-desolation-and-darkness#desolation) level. 

Winning[​](#winning "Direct link to Winning")
---------------------------------------------

Rather than a single winner, there are many Triumphs that a gang can achieve in an Underhells Campaign. Once the Survival phase ends, the Underhells Campaign is over. The Arbitrator then totals up each gang's total Exploration points earned, number of Malstrain Genestealers slain, final Reputation, and the number of battles fought by each gang, and then award [Triumphs to players](/docs/campaigns/underhells-campaign/running-the-campaign#winning).
