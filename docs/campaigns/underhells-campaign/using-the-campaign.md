# Using The Campaign
_Source: The Book of Desolation (2024)_

The Underhells Campaign is a complete narrative campaign that can be used alongside the _Necromunda Core Rulebook_. Unlike other Necromunda campaigns, it follows a group of daring explorers delving into the ancient ruins of Secundus in search of fabled archeotech. Each player takes on the role of a gang crossing the cursed wastes around the fallen hive and then descending into its ruined depths. Along the way they must fight the minions of the Matstrain Patriarch, and hopefully escape with their lives! 

The Arbitrator[​](#the-arbitrator "Direct link to The Arbitrator")
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Dominion Campaign requires one of the players to take on the role of an Arbitrator. It is the Arbitrator’s job to keep track of victories, offer guidance for the players and control any random events or elements. In the Dominion Campaign the Arbitrator’s responsibilities include:

*   Organising the players and making a list of all of the gangs involved in the campaign.
*   Keeping the players informed as to the progression of the campaign and keeping track of the control of Territories.
*   Deciding when each phase of the campaign begins and ends, as well as when the overall campaign starts and finishes.

The Gangs[​](#the-gangs "Direct link to The Gangs")
---------------------------------------------------

Each player in a Dominion Campaign needs to have a gang. This can be any gang currently available fromany of the Necromunda supplements, or those published in White Dwarf magazine or on the Warhammer Community website.

Controlling Territories[​](#controlling-territories "Direct link to Controlling Territories")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each Territory is a feature of key interest in the localised area of the underhive and wastes within which the gangs are fighting. A gang gains a Territory by winning a battle and holds onto it by winning future battles fought over its possession.

Pre- And Post-Battle Sequence[​](#pre--and-post-battle-sequence "Direct link to Pre- And Post-Battle Sequence")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Dominion Campaign uses all of the standard rules for the pre- and post-battle sequences presented earlier in this book, including the gaining and spending of XP.

Winning[​](#winning "Direct link to Winning")
---------------------------------------------

Rather than a single winner, there are many Triumphs that a gang can achieve in a Dominion Campaign. At the end of the last campaign cycle, the Dominion Campaign is over. The Arbitrator then totals up each gang’s total enemies taken Out of Action, final Wealth, final Reputation, and the number of Territories held by each gang, and then awards Triumphs to players.
