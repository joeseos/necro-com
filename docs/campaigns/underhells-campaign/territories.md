# Territories
_Source: The Book of Desolation (2024)_

During an Underhells Campaign, gangs are making the long journey from the Dust Wall into the depths of the Secundan Abyss untill finally making it into the claustrophobic ruins of the Underhells of Hive Secundus. This is a long and perilous journey, represented by the various Territories they hold as they move towards the campaign's conclusion.

Each Territory grants the holder a Boon, which is collected during the Collect Income step of the post-battle sequence. 

Territory Boons[​](#territory-boons "Direct link to Territory Boons")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Gangs gain a benefit from each Territory they control called a Boon. This Boon might be income, an additional gang member, a piece of rare or unique equipment or a special rule. 

A gang receives the benefits of a Territory’s Boon so long as it holds that Territory. Once the Territory is discarded as the gang moves on, the Boon is lost. 

### Income[​](#income "Direct link to Income")

lf a Territory provides income for the gang that controls it, the gang adds the amount of credits shown to their Stash when generating income after all battles. 

### Recruit[​](#recruit "Direct link to Recruit")

Some Territories grant gangs new fighters, Hired Guns or Hangers-on as recruits to the gang. These incur no cost to recruit but do add to the Gang Rating and Wealth value. 

Additionally, though any gang fighter recruited from the gang's House List incurs no cost to recruit, any equipment that is not part of the fighter’s basic cost must be purchased at the normal cost, or supplied from the gang’s Stash unless the Territory states otherwise. These fighters stay with the gang even after they have moved on and discarded the Territory.

Any Hired Gun recruited as a Boon has no cost, and will remain with the gang for as long as they control the Territory that grants the Boon.

Any Hanger-on recruited as a Boon has no cost, does not count towards the maximum number of Hangerson the gang may normally have, may be recruited without meeting the normal Reputation requirement and remains with the gang for as long as they control the Territory that grants the boon. 

### Special[​](#special "Direct link to Special")

The Boon grants a unique benefit to the gang that holds the Territory. The benefit follows the rules listed in the relevant entry for the Territory. When the Territory is lost then so is the benefit.
