# Running The Campaign
_Source: The Book of Desolation (2024)_

The Underhells Campaign is broken down into three main parts, each divided by a period of Downtime allowing gangs to lick their wounds and consolidate their strenght before venturing onto the next phase. Each phase runs for a variable number of cycles in which battles are played and victories are tallied. At the end of each cycle (as determined by the Arbitrator), the effects of the players’ battles are applied to the the campaign. 

The Underhells Campaign is divided up into five phases: 


|Phase              |Duration    |
|:------------------|:-----------|
|1. Incursion phase |Variable    |
|2. Downtime        |One cycle   |
|3. Delving phase   |Variable    |
|4. Downtime        |One cycle   |
|5. Survival phase  |Variable    |


Each phase is broken down as follows:

1\. Incursion Phase (Variable)[​](#1-incursion-phase-variable "Direct link to 1. Incursion Phase (Variable)")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_An ancient battlefield still strewn with the remains of the decade-long conflict to eliminate, and later contain,
the Hive Secundus Genestealer Cult uprising. The dead zone between the Dust Wall and the Secundan Abyss contains abandoned military camps, gutted war machines and dozens of ruined settlements, including the haunted remains of the dead hives Nostrum and Pulvaus._

The first part of the Underhells Campaign follows the gangs as they move through the dead zone within the Dust Wall towards the Secundan Abyss. During this phase, the following rules apply: 

*   The Madness level is set to Ghosts of the Dead (See page 71). 
*   The Desolation level is set to Limited Trade (see page 71). 
*   The Darkness level is set to Heavy Skies (see page 71). 

2\. Downtime (1 Cycle)[​](#2-downtime-1-cycle "Direct link to 2. Downtime (1 Cycle)")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During Downtime, gangs have a chance to recover and regroup, taking the opportunity to re-equip, fix up wounded fighters and repair and upgrade vehicles. Exceptionally bold and active players might put their gangs through a special [side battle](https://necrovox.org/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/running-the-campaign#side-battles) if they just can’t be away from the roar of guns and chainblades for that long.

### The Effects Of Downtime[​](#the-effects-of-downtime "Direct link to The Effects Of Downtime")

After their last battle of the Occupation phase, players complete the following steps at the end of the post-battle sequence:

A. Fighters Recover  
B. Captives are Returned  
C. Experienced Juves and Prospects are Promoted  
D. Fresh Recruitment

### A. Fighters Recover[​](#a-fighters-recover "Direct link to A. Fighters Recover")

Any In Recovery boxes on the gang roster are cleared.

### B. Captives Are Returned[​](#b-captives-are-returned "Direct link to B. Captives Are Returned")

Any Captured fighters are released. The gang that had Captured them receives half their credits value (rounding up to the nearest 5 credits).

### C. Experienced Juves And Prospects Are Promoted[​](#c-experienced-juves-and-prospects-are-promoted "Direct link to C. Experienced Juves And Prospects Are Promoted")

If any gang contains any Juves or Prospects with three or more Advancements, they may be promoted. Their characteristics and credits value are unaffected, but their Type is changed as described in their fighter entry.

### D. Fresh Recruitment[​](#d-fresh-recruitment "Direct link to D. Fresh Recruitment")

All gangs gain 250 credits to spend on new equipment from their Gang Equipment List or to recruit new fighters, vehicles and/or Hangers-on. These credits must be spent now and cannot be added to the gang’s Stash. Gangs may supplement these credits with extra credits from their Stash.

3\. Takeover Phase (3 Cycles)[​](#3-takeover-phase-3-cycles "Direct link to 3. Takeover Phase (3 Cycles)")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second part of the Dominion Campaign sees gangs defend their Territories against their rivals, as well as capture those controlled by other gangs. During this phase the following rules apply:

*   During the first campaign cycle of the Takeover phase, Ash Wastes battles take place during the Changing Seasons.
*   During the second and third campaign cycles of the Takeover phase, Ash Wastes battles take place during the Season of Flame.
*   Only controlled Territories may be fought over and claimed as rewards (see [Issuing and Accepting](https://necrovox.org/docs/campaigns/dominion-campaign/setting-up-the-campaign#issuing-and-accepting-challenges)).

Winning[​](#winning "Direct link to Winning")
---------------------------------------------

Victory in the Dominion Campaign can be measured in many ways, although simply surviving the fierce inter- gang warfare is an achievement in itself. At the end of the campaign, the Arbitrator awards Triumphs to the players depending on how their gangs have performed during the campaign.

The Arbitrator should have a look at the Triumphs at the start of the Dominion Campaign as some of them require keeping track of how many enemy models players have taken Out of Action or vehicles they have Wrecked, so these will need to be recorded. Likewise, the Arbitrator might like to make the players aware of the different Triumphs at the beginning of the campaign so that each player can decide if there is one or more they wish to try to achieve. Below is a list of the Dominion Campaign Triumphs:



* Triumph: Dominator
  * Criteria: Most Territories at the end of the campaign.
* Triumph: Slaughterer
  * Criteria: Most enemy fighters taken Out of Action and vehicles Wrecked across the whole campaign.
* Triumph: Creditor
  * Criteria: Largest Wealth at the end of the campaign.
* Triumph: Warmonger
  * Criteria: Most battles fought across the whole campaign.
* Triumph: Powerbroker
  * Criteria: Highest Reputation at the end of the campaign.

### Side Battles[​](#side-battles "Direct link to Side Battles")

Side battles are special battles fought during Downtime. While most players will be happy with taking a break for a week and getting ready for the Takeover phase, there may be a few who can’t go a week without their fix of gang warfare. To satisfy this need, an Arbitrator can run one or more side battles during Downtime. Side battles are fought after the effects of Downtime are applied.

Side battles should, as a rule, be unusual and have no effect on the campaign as a whole. They are a great opportunity for the Arbitrator to design a custom scenario, to use the [Arbitrator tools](https://necrovox.org/docs/category/arbitrator-tools), or to play some of the narrative scenarios. Models can earn Experience and suffer Lasting Injuries or Lasting Damage from a side battle, but should not gain or earn income, or gain credits or Reputation as a reward for a side battle. Instead, the Arbitrator should create a special reward for the victor or victors of a side battle, such as an unpredictable piece of archeotech, a unique chem, or a custom gang tactic.
