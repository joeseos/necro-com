# Roaming Horrors
_Source: The Book of Desolation (2024)_

The psychic awareness of the Malstrain Patriarch is constantly scanning the exclusion zone for prey, sending their minions out to eliminate intruders. The rules for Roaming Horrors are designed to be used in all scenarios for the Underhells Campaign, though if the Arbitrator wishes they can only be used for certain scenarios or not at all.
