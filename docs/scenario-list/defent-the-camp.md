_Source: The Book of Desolation (2024)_

Attacker And Defender[​](#attacker-and-defender "Direct link to Attacker And Defender")
---------------------------------------------------------

In this scenario, one gang is the attacker and the other is the defender. If this scenrio is being played as part of a campaign, then the gang that issued the challange is the attacker; otherwise, roll off with the winner deciding whether they will attack or defend.

Battle Type[​](#battle-type "Direct link to Battle Type")
---------------------------------------------------------

This scenario is an Underhive battle; vehicles and Wargear that grant the Mounted condition cannot be included in either gangs's starting crew or Reinforcements.

Battlefield[​](#battlefield "Direct link to Battlefield")
---------------------------------------------------------

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up a battlefield, as described in the Battlefield Set-up & Scenario selection of the _Necromunda Core Rulebook_.

Crews[​](#crews "Direct link to Crews")
---------------------------------------

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a crew; as described in the Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section of the _Necromunda Core Rulebook_. The attacking gang uses the Customer Selection (8) method to determine their starting crew. The defender's starting crew are their sentries. They use the Random Selection (4) method, but before drawing their crew, they can declare any number of fighters unfit (or too important) for sentry duty, removing them from their deck - they are returned to the deck after the starting crew has been drawn. The rest of the deck is then set to one side to form their Reinforcements deck.

Deployment[​](#deployment "Direct link to Deployment")
------------------------------------------------------

The defender sets up their sentries and the Target (see opposite) anywhere on the battlefield along two Traizor pattern sentry guns (see page 117). The attacker then sets up each of their fighters within 2" of any battlefield edge. 

Gang Tactics[​](#gang-tactics "Direct link to Gang Tactics")
------------------------------------------------------

This scenario uses the standard rules for gang tactics as described in the Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section of the _Necromunda Core Rulebook_, comparing Gang Ratings instead of starting crew. 

Ending the Battle[​](#ending-the-battle "Direct link to Ending the Battle")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately. 

Victory[​](#victory "Direct link to Victory")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If only the attacker has models remaining on the battlefield, or the Target has been taken off the battlefield, the attacker is victorious. Otherwise, the defender wins.
