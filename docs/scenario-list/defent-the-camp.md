# Defend The Camp

_Source: The Book of Desolation (2024)_

Attacker And Defender[​](#attacker-and-defender "Direct link to Attacker And Defender")
---------------------------------------------------------

In this scenario, one gang is the attacker and the other is the defender. If this scenrio is being played as part of a campaign, then the gang that issued the challange is the attacker; otherwise, roll off with the winner deciding whether they will attack or defend.

Battlefield[​](#battlefield "Direct link to Battlefield")
---------------------------------------------------------

Standard. Mark the centre point of the battlefield, this is the escape point. If using Sector Mechanicus, the escape point should be on an elevated platform - the higher the better!

Crews[​](#crews "Direct link to Crews")
---------------------------------------

*   Random (D3+4).

Tactics Cards[​](#tactics-cards "Direct link to Tactics Cards")
---------------------------------------------------------------

*   Custom (2).
*   Underdog (starting crew cost): +1 random per 100 credits.

Deployment[​](#deployment "Direct link to Deployment")
------------------------------------------------------

Alternate placing 3 loot caskets each, rolling off to see who will place the first casket. Loot caskets must be placed anywhere on the board at least 8” from any edge, 8” from another loot casket and 12” from the escape point. Roll-off again, the winner deploying first, choosing any board edge and putting down their entire crew within 6” of that edge. The other player then sets up their entire crew within 6” of the opposite board edge.

Objectives[​](#objectives "Direct link to Objectives")
------------------------------------------------------

The gangs are trying to grab as much loot as they can and then escape.

Special Rule: The Walls Are Moving![​](#special-rule-the-walls-are-moving "Direct link to Special Rule: The Walls Are Moving!")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the start of round 3, the player with priority should roll a D6 - on a 3+ the walls close in.

**Zone Mortalis:** Randomly select one of the edge-most tiles and remove it from the board (the tile with the escape point is always the last to be removed).

**Sector Mechanicus:** Randomize a board edge and remove all terrain within 6” of both this edge and the opposite edge - these areas are now no longer part of the battlefield.

Fighters caught in a vanishing part of the battlefield should make an Initiative test. If passed, move them to the nearest part of the board that is still part of the battlefield, otherwise they are taken Out of Action. Continue rolling at the start of each round to see if the walls close in until the scenario ends or there are no more battlefield left.

Escaping[​](#escaping "Direct link to Escaping")
------------------------------------------------

Fighters within 1” of the escape point may leave the battlefield at the start of any End phase (even if Seriously Injured). Fighters that have escaped are removed from the table and take no further part in the battle. They count as Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests.

Fleeing the Battlefield[​](#fleeing-the-battlefield "Direct link to Fleeing the Battlefield")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a gang voluntarily Bottles out and flees the battlefield, their opponent automatically wins the scenario. The winner claims any loot caskets left on the battlefield.

Ending the Battle[​](#ending-the-battle "Direct link to Ending the Battle")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The battle ends when at least 1 condition is true:

*   Only one gang has fighters remaining (at the end of a round).
*   No battlefield area remains (at the start of a round).

Victory[​](#victory "Direct link to Victory")
---------------------------------------------

The gang who escaped with the most loot caskets is the winner (or in case of a tie, the gang with most escaped fighters). Otherwise it is a draw.

Rewards[​](#rewards "Direct link to Rewards")
---------------------------------------------

#### Credits[​](#credits "Direct link to Credits")

*   D3x10 per loot casket the gang escaped with.

#### Experience[​](#experience "Direct link to Experience")

Scenario specific rewards:

*   +1 for taking part.
*   +1 for escaping.
*   +1 for escaping while carrying a loot casket.

*   +1 for taking an enemy Out of Action.
*   +1 for taking an enemy Leader or Champion Out of Action.
*   +1 for killing an enemy (during the battle).

#### Reputation[​](#reputation "Direct link to Reputation")
