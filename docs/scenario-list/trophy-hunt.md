Thin The Brood[​](#thin-the-brood "Direct link to Thin The Brood")

Two gangs are engaged in trying to secure as many kills of the Malstrain forces as they can in order to claim victory. As such each gang earns Victory points for Roaming Horrors destroyed: 1 VP for each Malstrain Tyramite or Brood Scum taken Out of Action, and 3 VP for each Malstrain Genestealer taken Out of Action. Any Leaders or Primes taken Out of Action are worth an extra 1 VP each.

Spawn Points[​](#spawn-points "Direct link to Spawn Points")
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battlefield has been set up, starting with the winner of a roll-off, each player takes it in turn to place 3 Spawn Points anywhere on the battlefield, at least 9" away from any battlefield edge and at least 12" away from another Spawn Point. The Spawn Points are then each assigned a number from 1 to 3.

Roaming Horrors[​](#roaming-horrors "Direct link to Roaming Horrors")
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting in the first round, Roaming Horrors are generated as described on page 82. Once they have been generated, the player with Priority rolls a D3 and places them all as close to the Spawn Point with the corresponding number as possible, at least 1" away from other fighters.

Fleeing The Battlefield[​](#fleeing-the-battlefield "Direct link to Fleeing The Battlefield")
