Escape The Ruins[​](#escape-the-ruins "Direct link to Escape The Ruins")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battlefield has been set up, starting with the winner of a roll-off, each player takes it in turn to place 6 Exit Points on any battlefield edge. Each Exit
Point must be placed at least 9" away from any other Exit Point.

The Exit Points are then each assigned a number from 1 to 6. Any model within 1" of an Exit Point may perform the Scout (Basic) action:

#### Scout (Basic): 
The model investigates to see if this is a way out of the ruins. Roll a D6 and add the number of previous attempts to Scout there have been during this battle. If the result is 7+, or this is the final Exit Point, the way out has been found! Otherwise, the Exit Point is a dead end – this action cannot be performed again on this Exit Point.

Once the way out has been found, the Scout (Basic) action may not be performed again.

#### Escaping The Battlefield
Once the way out has been found, any unengagedmodel within 1" of that marker at the end of eachround’s End phase manages to escape – removethemfrom the battlefield. They do not count as going Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle checks.

Roaming Horrors[​](#roaming-horrors "Direct link to Roaming Horrors")

Starting in the first round, Roaming Horrors are generated as described on page 82. Once they have been generated, the player with Priority rolls a D6 and places them all as close to the Exit Point with the corresponding number as possible, at least 1" awayfrom other models.
