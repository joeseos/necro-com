Vox Lock[​](#vox-lock "Direct link to Vox Lock")
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battlefield has been set up, starting with the winner of a roll-off, each player takes it in turn to place 3 Spawn Points anywhere on the battlefield, at least 9" away from any battlefield edge and 12" away from another Spawn Point.

The Spawn Points are then each assigned a number from 1 to 3. At the start of each End phase, before step 1 – Bottle Checks, the player with Priority scatters each Spawn Point 2D6" in a random direction. If the Spawn Point ends up off the battlefield or on impassable terrain, move it the least distance possible to have it remain on the battlefield and not in impassable terrain.

Roaming Horrors[​](#roaming-horrors "Direct link to Roaming Horrors")
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting in the second round, Roaming Horrors are generated as described on page 82. If a weapon with the Blast (3"/5"/*) trait was fired during the round, add 1 to the roll to generate Roaming Horrors. 

Once they have been generated, the player with Priority rolls a D3 and places them all as close to the Spawn Point with the corresponding number as possible, at least 1" away from other fighters.
