Attacker And Defender[​](#attacker-and-defender "Direct link to Attacker And Defender")
---------------------------------------------------------

In this scenario, one gang is the attacker and the other is the defender. If this scenrio is being played as part of a campaign, then the gang that issued the challange is the attacker; otherwise, roll off with the winner deciding whether they will attack or defend.

Battle Type[​](#battle-type "Direct link to Battle Type")
---------------------------------------------------------

This scenario is an Underhive battle; vehicles and Wargear that grant the Mounted condition cannot be included in either gangs's starting crew or Reinforcements.

Battlefield[​](#battlefield "Direct link to Battlefield")

This scenario uses the standard rules for setting up a battlefield, as described in the Battlefield Set-up & Scenario selection of the _Necromunda Core Rulebook_.

Crews[​](#crews "Direct link to Crews")
---------------------------------------

This scenario uses the standard rules for choosing a crew; as described in the Battlefield Set-up & Scenarios section of the _Necromunda Core Rulebook_. The attacking gang uses the Customer Selection (8) method to determine their starting crew. The defender's starting crew are their sentries. They use the Random Selection (4) method, but before drawing their crew, they can declare any number of fighters unfit (or too important) for sentry duty, removing them from their deck - they are returned to the deck after the starting crew has been drawn. The rest of the deck is then set to one side to form their Reinforcements deck.

Deployment[​](#deployment "Direct link to Deployment")

The defender sets up their sentries and the Target (see opposite) anywhere on the battlefield along two Traizor pattern sentry guns (see page 117). The attacker then sets up each of their fighters within 2" of any battlefield edge.

The Target[​](#the-target "Direct link to The Target")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The attacker is attemting to take something of value from the defender. If the defender has a Captive from the attacker's gang they are automatically the Target, otherwise use a marker such as a Loot Casket denote the target.

If a captive is the Target, they are assumed to have been subdued and so do not gain a Ready marker and not be activated.

Any attacking fighter within 1" of the Target may perform the carry Target (Basic) action:

**Carry Target (Basic)**: If this fighter is within 1" of the Target, they may make a Move (Simple) action, carrying the Target with them. When the action ends, the Target is placed in base contact with this fighter. 

Reinforcements[​](#reinforcements "Direct link to Reinforcements")

In the round that the alarm is raised, and in each subsequent round, D3 Reinforcements arrive for the defender.

Escaping The Battlefield[​](#escaping-the-battlefield "Direct link to Escaping The Battlefield")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If, at the start of the End phase, the Target is within 1" of any battlefield edge, they are removed from the battlefield. Once the Target has been removed from the battlefield, any attacking fighter within 1" of a battlefield edge may perform the Escape (Basic) action:

**Escape (Basic)**: Remove this fighter from the battlefield. They count as having been taken Out of Action for the purpose of Bottle checks.

Spawn Points[​](#spawn-points "Direct link to Spawn Points")
-----------------------------------------------------------

Before deploying their gang, the defender places six Spawn Points anywhere they wish within 1" of a battlefield edge and assigns them each a number from 1 to 6.

Roaming Horrors[​](#roaming-horrors "Direct link to Roaming Horrors")
--------------------------------------------------------------------

No Roaming Horrors are generated until the alarm has been raised. Once the alarm has been raised they are generated as described on page 82. Once they have been generated, the player with Priority rolls a D6 and places them all as close to the Spawn Point with the corresponding number as possible, at least 1" away from other models.

Fleeing The Battlefield[​](#fleeing-the-battlefield "Direct link to Fleeing The Battlefield")
