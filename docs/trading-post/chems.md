## Chem Suppliers[](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#chem-suppliers "Direct link to Chem Suppliers")

Chems can be found pretty easily in the depths of the Underhive. When buying a chem for the first time, the Availability Level applies. However, you've now found a dealer for that particular chem! From now on treat that chem as having common availability instead.

There is a catch: after buying, roll a D6. On a 1, the dealer has run dry, and the original Availability Level applies as you search for a new dealer.

All chems are single use. You can but multiple does in a single transaction.

## Side Effects, Duration And Mixing Chems[](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#side-effects-duration-and-mixing-chems "Direct link to Side Effects, Duration And Mixing Chems")

Chems have perks - why you take them - and side effects. Most side effects are bad, obviously.

Chems last for the battle (unless noted otherwise). They can be taken pre-battle, or during a battle with the **Use Chem (Simple)** action.

If a fighter takes multiple chems at the same time (like a mad cunt), they might have a really bad reaction. When taking a chem when under the effect of one or more other chems, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or under the number of chems they've taken (including the one they just took), the fighter goes Out of Action! They don't get a Lasting Injury, but go into recovery.

If a fighter has double dosed before the battle starts, they need to take this check as soon as they activate.
