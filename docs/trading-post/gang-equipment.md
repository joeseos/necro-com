### Ammo Cache[](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#ammo-cache "Direct link to Ammo Cache")

**60 Credits – Rare (8)**

Added to your stash first, this acts like a normal [Ammo Cache](https://necrovox.org/docs/battlefield-setup/scenario-rules#ammo-cache).

When setting up, you can choose to deploy any ammo caches you have. If you're the defender in a scenario, roll a D6 for each cache:

-   1-4: cannot use the cache.
-   5-6: deploy as normal.

Setup within 1" of a friendly fighter, in your deployment zone (if applicable). Remove it from your stash.

### Booby Traps (Frag, Gas & Melta)[](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#booby-traps-frag-gas--melta "Direct link to Booby Traps (Frag, Gas & Melta)")

**Frag – 20 Credits**  
**Gas – 40 Credits – Rare (8)**  
**Melta – 50 Credits – Rare (10)**

Place a marker to represent the trap at the start of the battle (before deploying fighters). If both players want to use traps, roll of to see who places first.

A trap can be set up by any fighter coming within 2" (for any reason).

Roll a D6.

| D6 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Trap is a dud, remove it from the battlefield |
| 2-3 | Trap isn't triggered and stays in place |
| 4-6 | The Trap goes off! The victim ends their movement if they get pinned/injured/stalled etc. |

Booby traps can be shot at, with -1 in short range and -2 in long range. If hit, roll a D6:

| D6 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1-2 | Nothing happens |
| 3-4 | It's triggered |
| 5-6 | It's destroyed without going off |

### Isotropic Fuel Rod[](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#isotropic-fuel-rod "Direct link to Isotropic Fuel Rod")

**60 Credits – Rare (10)**

Can be spent to turn any campaign territory into a Settlement.

### Mung Vase[](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#mung-vase "Direct link to Mung Vase")

**2d6x10 Credits – Rare (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Added to your stash.

Can be used to reduce the cost of a hired gun by D6x10 credits. If used, after that battle, roll a D6. On a 1, they steal it and both the vase and the hired gun vanish.

If your gang leader dies, the vase is lost (they hid it somewhere).

A vase can be sold in the trading sequence. Roll a d6:

| D6 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Dismal Fake** A truly sad knock-off. The vase nets the gang D3x5 credits. |
| 2-3 | **Passable Fake** A nice conversation piece. The vase nets the gang D6x10 credits. |
| 4-5 | **Impressive Fake** A fine example of the counterfeiters’ art. The vase nets the gang D6x20 credits. |
| 6 | **Outstanding Fake?** Make an Intelligence test for the gang Leader. If they fail, count this result as an Impressive Fake. If they pass, they realise what they have just in time – add D6x50 to the gang’s Stash. |
