:::note

:::

Servo-skulls are Wargear. Only fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule, Gang Leaders or Champions can buy and equip them.

Servo-skulls have the following additional rules:

-   They need to have a physical model. This stays within 2" of the owner at all times. The model is used for targeting and line of sight. It can't give away the owner's position.
-   When the owner activates, the skull flies alongside them, ignoring terrain (as long as it's passible), and can't fall.
-   The servo-skull can't be targets by attacks and can't be engaged in combat.
-   However, servo-skulls _can_ get caught in a blast or flame template. Attacker rolls a D6. On a 4+, the servo-skull is kit. The owner rolls a D6. On a 1, it's permanently destroyed. On a 2+ it's taken Out of Action, but takes no further damage.
-   If the owner is removed from the battlefield, the servo-skull goes with them.

### Gun Skull[](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/status-items/#gun-skull "Direct link to Gun Skull")

**65 Credits – Rare (12)**  
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Is equipped with an [autopistol](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/pistols#autopistol), and has a BS of 5+. It's not affected by any wargear or range modifiers of the owner.

The gun skull will shoot the same thing being targets by the owner's ranged attack. If the owner doesn't have a ranged attack, the player can choose what it shoots at.

Line of sight is figured out from the gun skull model. The owner is never considered in the way, so can't block line of sight or be hit by stray shots.
