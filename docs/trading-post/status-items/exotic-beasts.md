### 0-1 Caryatid[](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/status-items/#0-1-caryatid "Direct link to 0-1 Caryatid")

**AL:** Rare (15)  
Available to any Gang Leader.

| M | WS | BS | S | T | W | I | A | Ld | Cl | Wil | Int |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6" | 5+ | \- | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2+ | 1 | 7+ | 7+ | 8+ | 8+ |

**Weapons:** None (always make unarmed attacks).

#### Special Rules[](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/status-items/#special-rules "Direct link to Special Rules")

**Omen of Fortune:** When within 3" of its companion, the companion can avoid one successful hit per turn by making a willpower test (directly after the successful hit). If failed, the attack hits as normal. Applies to blast/template attacks, but the template still effects other models.

**Precognition:**

-   3+ save roll, can't be modified by AP.
-   If caught under blast/template, attacker needs to role a 4+ to hit, otherwise the Caryatid is missed by the attack.

**Symbol of Renown:** Gang’s Reputation is increased by +1 while attached to the gang leader. If the Caryatid is killed or abandons, the gang’s Reputation will be reduced by -2.

**Abandonment:** If the gang's repuation is reduced at all, roll a D6 and subtract the number of Reputation lost from the result. If the total is 1 or less, the Caryatid will abandon its companion. A natural roll of a 6 is always a success.

**Flight:** Ignores all terrain, may move freely between levels and can never fall.

**\*Lucky Find:** A Caryatid is not purchased. If the gang rolls an Availability level of 15 or higher when trading, a Caryatid may join you. Roll 2D6 and add the gang’s current Reputation. If the result is 20 or higher, a Caryatid has decided to form a bond with the gang Leader.

**Flight:** Ignores all terrain, may move freely between levels and can never fall.

**Grapple:** If a Grapplehawk successfully hits a fighter with its Talons, it is attached to the enemy and doesn't need to roll to hit in future attacks. They count as rolling a 6 for the purposes of the [Disarm](https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#3-disarm) and Entangle Traits.

**Swoop:** Must remain within 9" of its owner rather than 3".
