**House Cawdor only**

If equipped with a grenade, spend a Basic action (Prime Bomb Rat) action:

-   Make an Ammo roll as if used normally.
-   Place the bomb delivery rat B2B.
-   Make an Intelligence test to try to affect where the rat moves:
    -   Pass: Move 6" in a chosen direction.
    -   Fail: Move 6" in a random direction.

Rat movement:

-   Ignores all terrain (except impassable, walls etc.).
-   Suffers no penalties when climbing.
-   Leaps any gap of 2” or less freely (wider gaps are considered impassable).
-   Not a fighter, may move within 1” of other models.
-   Can be targeted by ranged or melee attacks, but apply an additional -1 hit modifier.
-   If hit, the grenade goes off on a 4+, then the rat is removed.

At the start of every subsequent round, after rolling for Priority but before activating any fighters, if the bomb delivery rat has not exploded then it will activate again.

Choose the direction and move the rat up 6” if all of the conditions apply for the fighter that deployed it is:

-   Within 9”
-   Active or Pinned
-   Passed an Intelligence test

Otherwise, if any of the following conditions apply to the fighter, move the rat in a random direction 6”:

-   Outside 9”
-   Failed the Intelligence test
-   Engaged
-   Seriously Injured
-   Out of Action

Should the rat at any time end its movement within 1” of a fighter (friend & foe), or another bomb delivery rat, roll a D6. On a 2+, the grenade will go off. On a 1, the grenade proves to be a dud and the rat vanishes into the darkness to dwell upon its good fortune. In either case, the rat is removed from play.
