# First Principles
_Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Unlike in the 2023 Core Rules, this Section lists _all_ items available in Necromunda.

:::note

This section includes everything from the Trading Post, gang lists and other sources such as gear unique to characters or scenarios.

Each page is divided into two sections: 'Trading Post' and 'Exclusive'. Trading Post items are available via the trading post, whereas Exclusive items are only available through other means (and are often restricted to a particular gang or fighter).

Items that are available on the Trading Post will be marked with their Availability Level (AL), such as C (Common), R9 (Rarity 9) or I6 (Illegal 6).

If an items is available to a gang via their gang list _cheaper_ than on the Trading Post, it is marked as follows. Note that you should reference your Gang Equipment list during gang creation, as some items are _more expensive_ on their gang lists.
