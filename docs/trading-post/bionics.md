# Bionics

:::note

This page has been reworded to comply with copyright. Refer to the _Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_ for its original text.

:::

In a campaign you can suffer lasting injuries with a permanent change to a fighter's stats. 'Installing' bionics will fix this injury, and make it harder to suffer the same lasting injury in the future.

There are two types of bionics:

-   **Mundane:** these cancel the effect of a **single** negative stat change from a lasting injury. If a lasting injury impacts two stats, the player must choose which one to fix (or buy an improved bionic instead).
-   **Improved:** these cancel the effect of **two** negative stat changes from a lasting injury.

Additional Rules:

-   The Doc fees are included in the price.
-   A bionic can't improve a characterisic beyond it's maximum (not even in conjunction with a stat Advancement).
-   If in recovery, a fighter stays in recovery.

## Damaged Bionics[](https://necrovox.org/docs/armoury/armour#damaged-bionics "Direct link to Damaged Bionics")

When suffering a lasting injury to a bionic location, roll a D6:

-   1-3: Lasting injury is suffered as normal.
-   4-6. Lasting injury is ignored.
    -   Roll another D6. On a 1, the bionic is destroyed, and the effect of the lasting injury is applied (along with removed the stat increase from the bionic)
