# Mounts

For Mount rules, see the [Mounted](https://necrovox.org/docs/general-principles/conditions#mounted) condition.
​
Mounts can't be purchased for or be combined with the following:
​
-   Vehicle crew.
-   Ash Waste Nomads (except when the mount is included for the fighter).
-   Wargear that affects movement (for example jump booster or grav-cutter).
​
:::INFO Vehicle Upgrades & Wargear
​
If all gangs agree, mounts can be customized by vehicle Upgrades & Wargear (up to one Upgrade per area). However Weapon Hardpoints cannot be added to a Mount (use the Custom Vehicle rules instead).
