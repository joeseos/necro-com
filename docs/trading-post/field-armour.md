# Field Armour

:::note

This page has been reworded to comply with copyright. Refer to an item's source for its original text.

:::

Field armour can be worn in addition to normal armour, and a fighter can wear more than one type of field armour. A save from field armour cannot be modified by a weapon's AP.

However, a figher can make only one save attempt per attack, so you must pick which one you want to use.

**Special Rules:** On a successful save, the fighter is teleported in a random direction (use the scatter dice) for a distance equal to the strength on the attack (eg S3 = 3").

They can't by placed inside impassable terrain or into engagement. In this case, place them as close as possible nearby.

If the wearer is teleported to a location where any of their base is over a hazard or a platform edge, pass an Initative test of suffer the consequences!

If they teleport off the battlefield, they go OoA with an Out Cold lasting injury.

If an attack doesn't have a Strength value, then a displacer field cannot work against it.
