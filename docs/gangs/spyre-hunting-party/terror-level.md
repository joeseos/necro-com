# Terror Level

As a Spyre Hunting Party gang moves through the underhlve, word of their presence and deeds spreads until all know there is a predator In their midst. As the Hunt's presence is felt more and more, other Spyrers operating in the area either move elsewhere where they will not be overshadowed, or occasionally join the Hunt. 

This is represented during Necromunda campaigns by the Terror level.

A gang·s Terror Level starts at 1. At the start of the Update Roster step of the post-battle sequence, increase the gang's Terror level according to the Terror level Increase table. There is no limit to the number of times Cull the leadership can be claimed during each post-battle sequence, though both Censure and Lightning Raid may only be claimed once per battle:
