# Terror Level

As a Spyre Hunting Party gang moves through the underhlve, word of their presence and deeds spreads until all know there is a predator In their midst. As the Hunt's presence is felt more and more, other Spyrers operating in the area either move elsewhere where they will not be overshadowed, or occasionally join the Hunt. 

This is represented during Necromunda campaigns by the Terror level.
