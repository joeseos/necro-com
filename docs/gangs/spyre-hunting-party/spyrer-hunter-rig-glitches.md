# Spyre Hunter Rig Glitches

When a Spyrer is taken Out of Action, instead of rolling on the Lasting Injury table in the _Necromunda Core Rulebook_, roll on the Spyrer Hunting Rig Glitches table below.

If, during the Purchase Advancements step of the post-battle sequence, a Spyrer's Glitch Count os higher than their Toughness characteristics, the hunter rig shuts down. Delete the Spyre Hunter and all the equipment from the gang rooster.
