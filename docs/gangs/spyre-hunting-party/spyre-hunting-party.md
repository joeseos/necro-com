# Spyre Hunting Party

:::note Why Play A Spyre Hunter Party Gang?

Spyrers are hunters without peer, n,erciless killers who stalk their prey before bringing thern down. They are noble scions of House Heln1awr, sent out into the deptl1s of Hive Secundus in order to prove the1nselves wortl1y of taking up positions of authority in the ln1perial House's don1ain, and as such they are very differenl to the norrnal gangs you will corne up against. When it conmes to playing a Spyre Hunting Party gang in canmaigns, every Spyre Hunter is a skilled individual equipped with an advanced hunting rig that has the potential to outshine anything used by the other denizens of the underhive. However, despite this potential they start out as a group of three or four fighters who will be constantly outnumbered and vulnerable to being overwhelmed. Caring little for the wealth sought by most gangs, Spyrers only care about increasing their kill count and so each battle the Spyrer player needs to focus on isolating enemy fighters and taking them down. Spyre Hunters excel in one-on-one encounters and hit and run tactics, but hey can be taken down by a combined assault or careless positioning. So if you enjoy stalking your prey and playing for different priorities than your opponents, all the while running a small elite gang which must rely upon cunning tactics to triumph then give the Spyre Hunting Party a try.  

:::

Gang Composition[​](#gang-composition "Direct link to Gang Composition")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Spyre Hunting Party is created using the standard rules for gang creation (see the Necromunda Core Rulebook) with the following exceptions:

*   A Spyre Hunting Party gang ignores the usual restriction on at least half of the models needing t have the Gang Fighter (X) special rule. 
*   After founding the gang any unspent credits are discarded, they do not go into the gang"s Stash. 

Aliances[​](#aliances "Direct link to Aliances")
---------------------------------------------------------------

A Spyre Hunting Party gang can never form an alliance.

Hired Guns[​](#hired-guns "Direct link to Hired Guns")
---------------------------------------------------------------

Hired Guns will not sign on to work with $pyre Huntir Party gangs unless their rules explicitly state they will.

Hangers-Ons[​](#hangers-ons "Direct link to Hangers-Ons")
---------------------------------------------------------------

Hangers-ons will not sign on to work with Spyre Hunting Party gangs unless their rules explicitly state they will.

Campaign Play[​](#campaign-play "Direct link to Campaign Play")
---------------------------------------------------------------

During a campaign, Spyre Hunting Party gangs function differently to other gangs in severnl ways as described below.

### Income, Equipment And Reqruitment

A Spire Hunting Party gang only gains credits or equipment during Downtime. Any credits or equipment gained at any other time that would be added to their Stash are instead dlscarded.

In addition, the only way a Spyre Hunting Party gang may recruit additional righters is through the Terror Level (see page 26).

**Downtime** During the Fresh Recruitment step of Downtime, Spyre Hunting Party gangs gain credits the same as all other gangs. These credits may only be used to perform the following actions: 

*   Exchange weapons and Wargear on any of their fighters.
-   Any weapon augmentations are lost if a weapon is swapped out. 
*   Purchase additional Wargear from their Equipment options.
*   Remove all Suit Glitches from a fighter for 100 credits.
*   Hire one or more Caryatid Primes.

Any unspent credits are discarded at the end of Downtime.

### Captives

Spyrers have no interest in selling Captives to Guilders or claiming bounties - as far as they are concerned, the only use for a Captive is as bait to lure more prey in. Spyre Hunting Parties cannot trade, sell or dispose of captives. 

Territories[​](#territories "Direct link to Territories")
---------------------------------------------------------------

Spyre Hunting Party gangs contest and control Territories in the same manner as other gangs. However, as they have no interest in working a Territory and extorting creditS or services from the local populace there are some key differences. 

### Boons

The only Territory a Spyre Hunting Party gang gains Boons from is the Spyrer Base Camp, all other Territories grant no Boons to a Spyre Hunting Party gang. 

### Terror Purge

Whenever a Spyre Hunting Party gang wins a battle as part of a campaign, they perform a Terror Purge during the Wrap up step of the post-battle sequence. 

*   When a gang performs a Terror Purge, every fighter in the gang earns 2 XP.

### Base Of Operation

In addition to any other Territory a Spyre Hunting Party gang controls, they always have a Spyrer Base Camp Territory which they can never lose.

### Unique Territory - Spyrer Base Camp

_A stronghold from which the Spyrers can operate, a Spyrer Base Camp is heavily fortified and highly mobile, moving with the Spyre Hunting Party gang so they always have a safe place to recover from battle and hone their skills._ 

### Territory Boon

**Recovery Systems:** During the Wrap-up of each battle the Spyre Hunting Party gang takes part in, one Spyrer may perform post-battle actions even if they are in Convalescence. A Spyre Hunting Party gang may never lose control of their Spyrer Base Camp Territory.

The Spyrer[​](#the-spyrer "Direct link to The Spyrer")
------------------------------------------------

A Spyrer is a noble of the Imperial House equipped with the most advanced technology that can be found on Necromunda, making them capable of taking on a Malstrain Genestealer and winning. As such, there are a number of special rules that apply to a Spyrer. 

### Reflex Enhancers

Dyring the Ready Gang step of the Priority Phase, all Spyrers gain one extra Ready marker; if an effect would prevent them from gettining a Ready marker, they gain one fewer Ready markers. Each time a Spyrer activates, they only remove one Ready marker - this means they will be able to activate twice each round. any effect that removes a Ready markers only removes one Ready marker from a Spyrer. 

### Master Of The Hunt

As Spyrers have a suite of speclal rules granted to them by their hunting rigs:

*   When a Spyrer is hit by a ranged attack, they are only placed Prone and Pinned if the attack damages them (e.g., they lose a Wound or suffer a Flesh Wound). 
*   A Spyrer may never be Captured for any reason, any time they are they instead are considered to have suffered Superficial Damage (see page 29).
*   Spyrers do not suffer side effects from chems and can never become addicted to them.
*   A Spyrer never needs to check if they become Broken as a result of a friendty model taking being taken Out of Action.
*   Spyre Hunting Party gangs take Bottle checks on a D3 Instead of on a D6. 

### Kill Count

Each Spyre hunting rig records all that happens to the Spyrer, verifying their kills and unlocking functions of the hunting rig and its weaponry as their kill count ticks up, making them an ever more dangerous foe. In addition to gaining XP, each time a Spyrer takes an enemy fighter Out of Action, increase the Spyrer's Kill Count by one.

All Spyre Hunters can perform the Suit Evolution post-battle action:

**Suit Evolutlon:** If a Spyrer's Kill Count is at least four, reduce their Kill Count by four, and either clear all Spyrer Hunting Rig Glitches (resetting their Glitch Count to zero and removing all negatives caused by the glitches), or increase power to their hunting rig as follows. If the Spyrer's Kill Count is still at least four, they may perform this action again.

To increase power to the hunting rig, roll a D6 on the Power Boost table, apply the result to the Spyrer and increase their credit cost by the amount shown:

**Power Boost Table**
|D6       |Result                                                                                                                                                                                     |Cost Increase|
|:------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
|**1**  |**Combat Neuroware:** The hunting rig links up additional neuroware which sharpens the Spyrer's fighting skills. Increase the Spyrer's WS or BS characteristic by 1 to a maximum of 2+.      |+20          |
|**5**  |**Heiehtened Reactions:** The hunting rig's reflexes sharpen significantly so that they react with incredible speed. Increase the Spyrer's Initiative characteristic by 1 to a maximum of 2+.|+10          |
|**3**  |**Improved Motive Power:** The hunting rigs power output for movement is boosted, increasing its speed. The Spyrer's Movement characteristic is increased by 1 to a maximum of 8".           |+10          |
|**4**  |**Thickened Armour:** The hunung rig's armour thickens and hardens, providing greater protection to the Spyrer. Increase the Spyrer's armour save by 1 to a maximum of 2+.                   |+15          |
|**5-6**|**Hunting rig Augmentation:** The hunting rig improves the power supply to one or its systems and brings additional functions online. Pick one weapon or piece of Wargear carried by the Spyrer and increase its Augmentation level by one. If the new Augmentation would Increase a characteristic beyond its maximum, increase the Augmentation level by an additional one.|+20          |

If a roll on the Power Boost table would increase e a characteristic beyond its maximum, treat the result as Hunting Rig Augmentation instead.
