# Spyre Hunting Party

:::note Why Play A Spyre Hunter Party Gang?

Spyrers are hunters without peer, n,erciless killers who stalk their prey before bringing thern down. They are noble scions of House Heln1awr, sent out into the deptl1s of Hive Secundus in order to prove the1nselves wortl1y of taking up positions of authority in the ln1perial House's don1ain, and as such they are very differenl to the norrnal gangs you will corne up against. When it conmes to playing a Spyre Hunting Party gang in canmaigns, every Spyre Hunter is a skilled individual equipped with an advanced hunting rig that has the potential to outshine anything used by the other denizens of the underhive. However, despite this potential they start out as a group of three or four fighters who will be constantly outnumbered and vulnerable to being overwhelmed. Caring little for the wealth sought by most gangs, Spyrers only care about increasing their kill count and so each battle the Spyrer player needs to focus on isolating enemy fighters and taking them down. Spyre Hunters excel in one-on-one encounters and hit and run tactics, but hey can be taken down by a combined assault or careless positioning. So if you enjoy stalking your prey and playing for different priorities than your opponents, all the while running a small elite gang which must rely upon cunning tactics to triumph then give the Spyre Hunting Party a try.  

:::

Gang Composition[​](#gang-composition "Direct link to Gang Composition")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Spyre Hunting Party is created using the standard rules for gang creation (see the Necromunda Core Rulebook) with the following exceptions:

*   A Spyre Hunting Party gang ignores the usual restriction on at least half of the models needing t have the Gang Fighter (X) special rule. 
*   After founding the gang any unspent credits are discarded, they do not go into the gang"s Stash. 

Aliances[​](#aliances "Direct link to Aliances")
---------------------------------------------------------------

A Spyre Hunting Party gang can never form an alliance.

Hired Guns[​](#hired-guns "Direct link to Hired Guns")
---------------------------------------------------------------

Hired Guns will not sign on to work with $pyre Huntir Party gangs unless their rules explicitly state they will.

Hangers-Ons[​](#hangers-ons "Direct link to Hangers-Ons")
---------------------------------------------------------------

Hangers-ons will not sign on to work with Spyre Hunting Party gangs unless their rules explicitly state they will.

Campaign Play[​](#campaign-play "Direct link to Campaign Play")
---------------------------------------------------------------

During a campaign, Spyre Hunting Party gangs function differently to other gangs in severnl ways as described below.

### Income, Equipment And Reqruitment

A Spire Hunting Party gang only gains credits or equipment during Downtime. Any credits or equipment gained at any other time that would be added to their Stash are instead dlscarded.

In addition, the only way a Spyre Hunting Party gang may recruit additional righters is through the Terror Level (see page 26).

**Downtime** During the Fresh Recruitment step of Downtime, Spyre Hunting Party gangs gain credits the same as all other gangs. These credits may only be used to perform the following actions: 

*   Exchange weapons and Wargear on any of their fighters.
-   Any weapon augmentations are lost if a weapon is swapped out. 
*   Purchase additional Wargear from their Equipment options.
*   Remove all Suit Glitches from a fighter for 100 credits.
*   Hire one or more Caryatid Primes.

Any unspent credits are discarded at the end of Downtime.

**Captives**

Spyrers have no interest in selling Captives to Guilders or claiming bounties - as far as they are concerned, the only use for a Captive is as bait to lure more prey in. Spyre Hunting Parties cannot trade, sell or dispose of captives. 

Territories[​](#territories "Direct link to Territories")
---------------------------------------------------------------

Spyre Hunting Party gangs contest and control Territories in the same manner as other gangs. However, as they have no interest in working a Territory and extorting creditS or services from the local populace there are some key differences. 

**Boons** 

The only Territory a Spyre Hunting Party gang gains Boons from is the Spyrer Base Camp, all other Territories grant no Boons to a Spyre Hunting Party gang.
