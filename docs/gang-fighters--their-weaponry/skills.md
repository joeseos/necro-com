# Skills
:::note

This page has been reworded to comply with copyright. Refer to the _Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_ for its original text.

:::

This page lists all the universal skills for fighters. They belong to nine different categories (also called 'Sets'). More senior fighters such as leaders and champions normally take a skill at gang creation, and more are unlocked with XP. Other fighters such as Bounty Hunters often have skills already included in their profile.

A fighter's rules details what skill categories are available to them, as either Primary or Secondary. 'Buying' these skills with XP has varying cost depending if it's a Primary skill, a Secondary skill and how you pick it (either chosen or random).

Crew are treated a little differently: they can only gain skills from the Driving, Leadership, Shooting and Savant categories.

### Universal Skills and Gang Specific Skills[​](#universal-skills-and-gang-specific-skills "Direct link to Universal Skills and Gang Specific Skills")

A number of gangs also their own unique set of skills that they have access to. These are listed in [Gang-Specific Skills](https://necrovox.org/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/gang-specific-skills).

### 4\. Mighty Leap[​](#4-mighty-leap "Direct link to 4. Mighty Leap")
