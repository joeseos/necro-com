# Skills
note

This page has been reworded to comply with copyright. Refer to the _Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_ for its original text.

This page lists all the universal skills for fighters. They belong to nine different categories (also called 'Sets'). More senior fighters such as leaders and champions normally take a skill at gang creation, and more are unlocked with XP. Other fighters such as Bounty Hunters often have skills already included in their profile.

A fighter's rules details what skill categories are available to them, as either Primary or Secondary. 'Buying' these skills with XP has varying cost depending if it's a Primary skill, a Secondary skill and how you pick it (either chosen or random).

Crew are treated a little differently: they can only gain skills from the Driving, Leadership, Shooting and Savant categories.

### 4\. Mighty Leap[​](#4-mighty-leap "Direct link to 4. Mighty Leap")

If Engaged they can perform the following action:

**Hurl (Basic):** Pick an enemy fighter that's Engaged with the fighter and in base contact, or a Seriously Injured enemy fighter within 1". The target makes an Initiative test.
